### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Felipe Rodriguez from Puerto Montt, Chile. I am a student of Computer Engineering and a Higher Technician in Computer Science. Currently, I work as a TI consultant, developer, and web page creator.

I have excellent ability to create solutions and provide immediate response to any scope a web project may have. That is why my mission is to help companies have a modern and fresh website to improve their corporate image.

Remember that updates and renovations are constant over time. Do not lag behind and if you want a change, let's talk and I can help you grow and improve your business image.
